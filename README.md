# Challenge 7 - Slicing Figma design into code with React Vite & Tailwindcss

# Description

In this assignment, you'll translate a provided Figma design into a functional webpage using React Vite and Tailwind CSS.

You'll be provided with a basic project setup, and your task will be to implement the design by writing components that reusable and utilizing Tailwind's classes.

The design for this assignment is located at the following Figma link:

[Figma Design Link](https://www.figma.com/design/SiIl1A1UdSOVLKrtMjgHD2/Company-Profile---Batch-4?node-id=8411-143671&t=wyqKMkBKZYGo958y-1)

The goal is to assess your ability to:

- Interpret a design from Figma.
- Create a reusable component
- Structure a webpage with vite.
- Apply styles using Tailwind CSS.
- Create a responsive layout.

# Folder Structure

You are provided with the following folder structure:

```
root/
  ├── node_modules/
  ├── public/
  ├── src/
  │ ├── components/
  │ │ ├── container/
  │ │ └── ui/
  │ └── App.tsx
  │ └── index.css
  │ └── main.tsx
  ├── .gitignore
  ├── eslint.config.js
  ├── package-lock.json
  ├── package.json
  └── readme.md
  └── tsconfig.app.json
  └── tsconfig.json
  └── tsconfig.node.json
  └── vite.config.ts
```

# Important file/folder to understanda

- public: all asset should go here, ex: images, icons, fonts
- src: a folder for all of the source code
- src/components: this folder is to create components that you can reuse
- src/components/ui: this folder is for component that only return one HTML tag, like button, input, etc.
- src/components/container: this folder is for component that have more than 1 component (ex: search bar = input and button), also you can create page section here
- vite.config.ts: see this file for tailwind setup on vite

# Assignment Objectives

- Figma to HTML: Accurately translate the Figma design into HTML. Create the necessary HTML elements to structure the page (divs, sections, headers, etc.).
- Tailwind CSS Styling: Use Tailwind CSS classes to style the HTML elements. Pay close attention to:
- Layout (Flexbox, Grid).
- Spacing (padding, margin).
- Typography (font sizes, weights, colors).
- Colors and Backgrounds.
- esponsive design (using Tailwind's responsive prefixes, e.g., md:, lg:).
- Responsive Design: Ensure your implementation is responsive across different screen sizes, as defined in the Figma design. Use Tailwind's responsive modifiers.
- Adherence to Design: Your final webpage should closely match the visual design provided in the Figma file.

# Getting Started

Don't forget to run

```
npm install
```

for this project first, then to run the app, run

```
npm run dev
```

on terminal

Study the Figma Design: Open the Figma link and thoroughly examine the design. Understand the layout, spacing, colors, typography, and responsive behavior.

HTML Structure: Open the public/index.html file. Begin by structuring the page with HTML elements that mirror the design.

Tailwind CSS: Use Tailwind CSS classes directly within your HTML elements to apply styles. For example:

<div class="flex justify-center items-center">...</div>

<h1 class="text-3xl font-bold text-blue-600">...</h1>

Test in the Browser: Run npm run dev to see it on your browser

Iterate: Continue to refine your HTML and Tailwind CSS until your webpage accurately matches the Figma design.

# Important Notes

You can modify the folder structure only on src and public folder, don't change anything related to project setup

Tailwind CSS Documentation: Refer to the official Tailwind CSS documentation (https://tailwindcss.com/docs) for information on available classes and how to use them.

Figma Inspection: Use the "Inspect" feature in Figma to get precise measurements, colors, and font styles from the design.

# Evaluation System

The evaluation for this assignment will be based on the following criteria:

1.  **Design Accuracy:** How accurately your implementation matches the design provided in Figma across different screen sizes.
2.  **Reusable Component:** How you can split your code into readable and not a bunch of code in one single component
3.  **Effective CSS Usage:** The correct and efficient use of CSS selectors, as well as understanding of basic CSS properties and _media queries_ (if responsiveness is implemented).
4.  **Code Readability and Organization:** HTML and CSS code that is well-structured, easy to read, and commented where necessary.
